/**
 * Helper class for the local file sharing module.
 *
 * Once two peer devices are connected through wifi direct, this task is executed to perform a
 * handshake between the two devices. The purpose of the handshake is to allow the file sending
 * device to obtain the IP address of the file receiving device (When the file sending device
 * is the wifi direct group owner, it doesn't have the IP address of the peer device by default).
 *
 * After obtaining the IP address, the sender also shares metadata regarding the file transfer
 * (no. of files & their names) with the receiver. Finally, the onPostExecute() of the sender
 * initiates the file transfer through [SenderDevice] on the sender and using
 * [ReceiverDevice] on the receiver.
