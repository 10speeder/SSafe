# Kiwix Android

Kiwix is an offline reader for Web content. One of its main purposes
is to make [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) available
offline. This is achieved by reading archives in the
[ZIM](https://openzim.org) file format, a highly compressed open format
with additional metadata.

This is the version for Android, with [support versions ranging from 7.1
to 15](https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-android/blob/main/buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/Config.kt).

Kiwix Android is written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).

## Important Notes

Starting from Android 11, Google has introduced a new very restrictive
policy which concretly forbids Kiwix [Play Store
variant](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kiwix.kiwixmobile)
users to directly load ZIM files from internal/external storage. For
the same reason, and still only in the Play Store variant, the storage
scanning feature has been removed.

Actualy, Kiwix Play Store variant can only directly scan/read ZIM
files in reserved app directories:

| Directory name   | Storage path                                                | Readable by File manager |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Internal public  | `storage/0/Android/media/org.kiwix.kiwixmobile/`            | Yes                      |
| Internal private | `storage/0/Android/data/org.kiwix.kiwixmobile/`             | No                       |
| External public  | `storage/sdcard-name/Android/media/org.kiwix.kiwixmobile/`  | Yes                      |
| External private | `storage/sdcard-name/Android/data/org.kiwix.kiwixmobile/`   | No                       |

As a workaround, for ZIM files downloaded through third party apps,
Kiwix users can use the file picker (in Kiwix library) to select these
ZIM files... which then will be copied/moved to one of the the Kiwix
app public directories (see above). An operation which can also be
done manually.

Be careful, before uninstalling Kiwix, if the user wants to keep its
ZIM files, he will have to move them outside of the app
directory. Otherwise, the ZIM file might be removed during the
process.

To use the full version of Kiwix and avoid to suffer of this
restriction, you can download it directly from the [official
repository](https://download.kiwix.org/release/kiwix-android/) or use
[IzzyOnDroid](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/org.kiwix.kiwixmobile).

We understand that this restriction may cause inconvenience, but it is
necessary to comply with the Play Store policies and ensure a smooth
user experience.  We recommend using the official version of the app
available on our website to access the complete set of features.

## App variants

Starting from version `3.12.0`, Kiwix now offers two variants of the application:

1. **PlayStore version:** App ID: `org.kiwix.kiwixmobile`.
2. **Full version:** App ID: `org.kiwix.kiwixmobile.standalone` available on our [official
repository](https://download.kiwix.org/release/kiwix-android/).
   
Both variants have the different app id meaning these are two different apps.

**What are the difference between these variants**

The Play Store version has a limitation when it comes to scanning ZIM files from your storage,
as mentioned in the [Important Notes](https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-android?tab=readme-ov-file#important-notes).
In contrast, the full version of the application can scan storage and load ZIM files directly from
other storage locations via the file picker, without requiring them to be copied or moved
to the app-specific directory. While the core functionality of both versions remains the same,
the primary difference lies in the ability to access ZIM files from outside the app-specific directory.

**Why two variants**

To avoid confusion between the Play Store version and the full version, we introduced separate app
IDs for each variant.
Using the same app ID for both versions caused conflicts with the Play Store, as it treated them as
the same app. This resulted in scenarios where the Play Store would prompt updates for the full
version. If users updated through the Play Store, they would lose advanced file management
capabilities (such as scanning storage or directly opening ZIM files using the file picker).

This separation ensures clarity for users and prevents undesirable behavior.

**How previous full version users move their content in this new app**

For user who are using the previous full version of the application can download the new version of
application from our [official repository](https://download.kiwix.org/release/kiwix-android/), and
move the bookmarks by exporting them from the previous version and importing them into new version of the app, the
options are available in the "Settings" screen.
For the already downloaded library move the ZIM files from
"Android/media/org.kiwix.kiwixmobile/" or "Android/data/org.kiwix.kiwixmobile/" from both internal
and SD card to other storage locations before uninstalling the previous full version of the app,
the new version of the application can load your all ZIM files available in your storage location.
You just need to swipe down on the "Library" screen and it will scan your storage and load your all
ZIM files in the application.

The migration is a one-time process. After completing it, you can directly download the new version
of the application from our [official repository](https://download.kiwix.org/release/kiwix-android/),
and it will update your current full version of the app when you install it.

## Android permissions needed

Kiwix requires the following permissions to fully work:

- `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`: Required on devices running Android 12 and below to discover nearby 
   devices when transferring ZIM files.
- `NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES`: Required on devices running Android 13 and above to discover nearby devices
   for transferring ZIM files.
- `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`: Required to access and read ZIM files stored on the device.
- `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`: Required to download ZIM files, export bookmarks, save notes, etc.
- `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`: Required to display notifications for ongoing downloads, active hotspots, 
   and the read-aloud feature.
- `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`: Required on Android 11 and above to scan the storage and locate all
   ZIM files. This permission is only available in the full version of the application.

## Build instructions

To build Kiwix Android, clone [this
repository](https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-android) and import (not
open) the project with [Android
Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

If you prefer to build without Android Studio you must first set up
the Android SDK and then run the command: `./gradlew build ` from the
root directory of the project. The project requires `Java 17` to run,
Therefore set the `Gradle JDK` to `Java 17`.

Kiwix Android is a multi-module project, in 99% of scenarios you will
want to build the `app` module in the `debug` configuration. If you
are interested in our custom apps, they have their own repo
[kiwix-android-custom](https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-android-custom).

## Release

We have an [automatic version code generation](https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-android/blob/main/buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/VersionCodeGenerator.kt) system based on the current date. However, you 
can override this by setting the environment variable `KIWIX_ANDROID_RELEASE_DATE` to a specific
date in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format. This will use the provided date for the version code calculation
instead of the current date.
