# Kiwix Android

Kiwix is an offline reader for Web content. One of its main purposes
is to make [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) available
offline. This is achieved by reading archives in the
[ZIM](https://openzim.org) file format, a highly compressed open format
with additional metadata.

This is the version for Android, with [support versions ranging from 7.1
to 15](https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-android/blob/main/buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/Config.kt).

Kiwix Android is written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).

## Important Notes

Starting from Android 11, Google has introduced a new very restrictive
policy which concretly forbids Kiwix [Play Store
variant](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kiwix.kiwixmobile)
users to directly load ZIM files from internal/external storage. For
the same reason, and still only in the Play Store variant, the storage
scanning feature has been removed.

Actualy, Kiwix Play Store variant can only directly scan/read ZIM
files in reserved app directories:

| Directory name   | Storage path                                                | Readable by File manager |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Internal public  | `storage/0/Android/media/org.kiwix.kiwixmobile/`            | Yes                      |
| Internal private | `storage/0/Android/data/org.kiwix.kiwixmobile/`             | No                       |
| External public  | `storage/sdcard-name/Android/media/org.kiwix.kiwixmobile/`  | Yes                      |
| External private | `storage/sdcard-name/Android/data/org.kiwix.kiwixmobile/`   | No                       |

As a workaround, for ZIM files downloaded through third party apps,
Kiwix users can use the file picker (in Kiwix library) to select these
ZIM files... which then will be copied/moved to one of the the Kiwix
app public directories (see above). An operation which can also be
done manually.

Be careful, before uninstalling Kiwix, if the user wants to keep its
ZIM files, he will have to move them outside of the app
directory. Otherwise, the ZIM file might be removed during the
process.

To use the full version of Kiwix and avoid to suffer of this
restriction, you can download it directly from the [official
repository](https://download.kiwix.org/release/kiwix-android/) or use
[IzzyOnDroid](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/org.kiwix.kiwixmobile).

We understand that this restriction may cause inconvenience, but it is
necessary to comply with the Play Store policies and ensure a smooth
user experience.  We recommend using the official version of the app
available on our website to access the complete set of features.

## Android permissions needed

Kiwix requires the following permissions to fully work:

- `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`: Required on devices running Android 12 and below to discover nearby 
   devices when transferring ZIM files.
- `NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES`: Required on devices running Android 13 and above to discover nearby devices
   for transferring ZIM files.
- `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`: Required to access and read ZIM files stored on the device.
- `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`: Required to download ZIM files, export bookmarks, save notes, etc.
- `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`: Required to display notifications for ongoing downloads, active hotspots, 
   and the read-aloud feature.
- `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`: Required on Android 11 and above to scan the storage and locate all
   ZIM files. This permission is only available in the full version of the application.

## Build instructions

To build Kiwix Android, clone [this
repository](https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-android) and import (not
open) the project with [Android
Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

If you prefer to build without Android Studio you must first set up
the Android SDK and then run the command: `./gradlew build ` from the
root directory of the project. The project requires `Java 17` to run,
Therefore set the `Gradle JDK` to `Java 17`.

Kiwix Android is a multi-module project, in 99% of scenarios you will
want to build the `app` module in the `debug` configuration. If you
are interested in our custom apps, they have their own repo
[kiwix-android-custom](https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-android-custom).

## Release

We have implemented an [automatic version code generation](https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-android/blob/main/buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/VersionCodeGenerator.kt) system based on the current date.
This ensures that every new build is generated with a unique version code daily.
If you need to generate an APK or app bundle for a specific date, you can do so by creating and pushing one of the following tags:

- `internal_testing_vYYYY-MM-DD`: If you want to publish the app bundle for a specific date on play store, create a tag e.g. `internal_testing_v2024-12-18` and push it.
   This will automatically trigger the [testing_release](https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-android/blob/main/.github/workflows/testing_release.yml) workflow, which generates the app bundle
   and publishes the application to the internal testing track on the play store.
- `dummy_bundle_and_apk_vYYYY-MM-DD`: If you need a bundle or APK for specific date, create a tag e.g. `dummy_bundle_and_apk_v2024-12-18` and push it, it will automatically triggered
   the [dummy_bundle_and_apk](https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-android/blob/main/.github/workflows/dummy_bundle_and_apk.yml) workflow, which creates the app bundle and APK for specific date.
   The generated files can be found in the triggered workflow.
